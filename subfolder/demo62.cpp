/* ***********Introduction to STL in C++**********
STL- stand for Standard Template Library 
Library of Generic classes and functions 
Components of STL:  1) Containers ->  Object which Store data. 
//                  2) Algorithm -> Procedure to store data.
//                  3) Iterators -> it is an Objct points to an element in a container 
//                                  it connect algorithm with containers.


********1)Containers*********
# Types of Containers 
i)   Sequence Containers -> Stored Data in linear fashion ie. one by one eg. Vector,
//                             list, Dequeue
ii)  Associative Containers -> Direct Access,searching  eg. Set, Multiset, Map, Multimap
iii) Derived Containers -> Real world modeling eg. Stack,queue,priority queue


***Sequence Containers*****
Vector- Random Access is fast 
       inserction/Deletion are slow in vector 
       inserction/Deletion  at the last end is fast 

List - Random acces is fast 
       Medel inserction is fast 
       inserction/deletion at the end fast

********Associative Containers******- All operations are fast except Random access.

**********Derived Containers******* - operations speed depends upon data
